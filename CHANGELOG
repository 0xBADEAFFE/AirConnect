0.2.0.5
 - alac.c compiles depends on endianness
 - Some players (Roon) send a FLUSH after a TEARDOWN which caused access to a NULL hairtunes context

 - mDNS records is now 120s (per RFQ) and not 75m so that in case of crash, player do not appear sticky for some applications
 - add possibility to dump players ('dump' & 'dumpall' commmands)
 - in SETUP response, cport and tport are set to 0 by default which will cause session to fail if none of these are provided
 - handle "header folding" in HTTP response
 - HTTP headers w/o : should not crash kbd_free
